ShedRain - Commissions

- ShedRain pays sales commissions based on net sales (Amount - discount)
- Sometimes a secondary rep  shares in the commission:
	-- One rep that gets 15%, second rep gets 2% of the total amount (net sales).
	ex. SO:
		item 1 - 100
			Rep 1 - 15% = 15 USD
			Rep 2 - 2%	= 2 USD

- We don't deduct the cost from sales.


To do's:

 - Custom Record: Plan Table
 	- Rep
 	- Department
 	- Commission Percentage
 	- Start Date
 	- End Date
 	- Customer
 	- Region
 	- 

 	- Customer and Department is blank, then it's global percentage



 - Most of the customers have reps
 - 3 customers that are different and those are tied via department


So for the majority of customers, it doesn't matter what is sold, the cells Rep gets there in standard percentage.
For these three customers, you have another layer, so for if you when when any Rep cells to Home Depot there is a different rate per department of stuff that is sold.

Department - type of thing that is sold.

- Rep could get paid 2% for Home Depot umbrellas and 3% for Cole's umbrellas. And standard 5% for everything else regardless of customer or department
